I imported OLTP Adventure works database.
Designed Star schema with Sales Fact tables and required dimensions.
I created a dashboard with 3 pages	Overall, Company Performance with general view on the areas, salespersons, order frequency and products.
then Operation report that shows me my sales team performance so I could reward them, Compare them performance to others and with them performance with previous Month and Quarter.
last report about our products.
I added filters synced between pages and buttons to navigate between report pages.
